```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```
**Expected:** ‚úÖ Database created, all migrations applied

## Test 4: Seed Data Loading
**Test seed script works:**
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```
**Expected:** ‚úÖ Sample data loaded successfully

## Test 5: Database Browser Verification
**Open Prisma Studio to inspect data:**
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
**Manual Check:**
- [ ] All tables present (should be ~20 tables)
- [ ] Sample data visible in tables
- [ ] Relationships working (foreign keys)

## Test 6: Schema Requirements Verification

### 6.1 User Management Tables
**Expected Tables:**
- [ ] `User` - User accounts
- [ ] `UserProfile` - User profiles  
- [ ] `UserPreference` - User preferences

### 6.2 Content Structure Tables
**Expected Tables:**
- [ ] `Unit` - Learning units
- [ ] `Lesson` - Individual lessons
- [ ] `LearningObjective` - Learning objectives
- [ ] `Content` - Lesson content

### 6.3 Assessment Tables
**Expected Tables:**
- [ ] `Assessment` - Assessment definitions
- [ ] `Question` - Assessment questions
- [ ] `UserResponse` - User answers
- [ ] `Score` - Scoring records

### 6.4 Progress Tracking Tables
**Expected Tables:**
- [ ] `UserProgress` - Overall progress
- [ ] `LessonCompletion` - Lesson completion status
- [ ] `ObjectiveMastery` - Objective mastery tracking

### 6.5 Analytics Tables
**Expected Tables:**
- [ ] `LearningAnalytics` - Learning patterns
- [ ] `PerformanceMetric` - Performance tracking

## Test 7: Mastery Learning Compliance
**Check for mastery learning fields:**
- [ ] Progress tracking with percentage scores
- [ ] Mastery thresholds (80%/90%) configuration
- [ ] Attempt counting and time tracking
- [ ] Retention check scheduling

## Test 8: Data Integrity Tests
**Test foreign key relationships:**
```bash
# Run these in Prisma Studio or database console
# Check that foreign keys prevent invalid data
```

## Test 9: Sample Data Verification
**Verify seed data includes:**
- [ ] At least 2 test users
- [ ] 1 unit with 3 lessons
- [ ] Learning objectives for lessons
- [ ] Sample exercises/assessments
- [ ] Progress records showing different mastery levels

## Test 10: TypeScript Integration
**Test generated Prisma client:**
```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```
**Expected:** ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors with Prisma types

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ PASSED
- [ ] File structure complete
- [ ] Schema validates successfully
- [ ] Migrations run without errors
- [ ] Seed data loads properly
- [ ] All required tables present
- [ ] Mastery learning fields implemented
- [ ] Sample data comprehensive
- [ ] TypeScript integration works

### ‚ùå FAILED
- [ ] Issue 1: [Description]
- [ ] Issue 2: [Description]
- [ ] Issue 3: [Description]

## Next Steps After Testing

### If All Tests Pass:
1. Mark Task 1.1 as ‚úÖ VERIFIED in ZenCoder's log
2. Update dependent tasks to üü¢ AVAILABLE:
   - Task 1.2: Core Database Queries
   - Task 11.1: Database Provider Abstraction
   - Task 10.1: Content Data Models & Schema

### If Tests Fail:
1. Document issues in this file
2. Create bug report for ZenCoder
3. Keep Task 1.1 status as needs revision
4. Block dependent tasks until fixes complete

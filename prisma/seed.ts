## What is a Noun?

A **noun** is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are the foundation of sentences and help us communicate clearly about the world around us.

## Types of Nouns

### 1. Common Nouns
Common nouns name general people, places, or things.
- Examples: *dog, city, book, happiness*

### 2. Proper Nouns
Proper nouns name specific people, places, or things and are always capitalized.
- Examples: *Sarah, New York, iPhone, Christmas*

### 3. Abstract Nouns
Abstract nouns name ideas, feelings, or concepts that cannot be touched.
- Examples: *love, courage, freedom, intelligence*

### 4. Concrete Nouns
Concrete nouns name things you can see, touch, hear, smell, or taste.
- Examples: *apple, music, perfume, sandpaper*

## Practice Exercise

"The brave firefighter rescued the frightened cat from the tall tree."

## Learning Content

### Concept 1: What Makes a Complete Sentence?

**Simple Definition:**
"A complete sentence expresses a complete thought and has two main parts: a subject (who or what) and a predicate (what they do or are)."

**The Sentence Recipe:**

```
SUBJECT + PREDICATE = COMPLETE SENTENCE

Who/What + What they do/are = Complete thought
```

**Examples:**

- **Dogs** (subject) **bark** (predicate). ✓
- **My sister** (subject) **loves chocolate** (predicate). ✓
- **Running fast** (no clear subject - who is running?) ✗
- **The big house** (no predicate - what about the house?) ✗

**Memory Trick:**
"A sentence is like a seesaw - it needs both sides (subject AND predicate) to work!"

**Complete Thought Test:**
Ask yourself: "Does this tell me who or what AND what they do or are?"

- "The cat sleeps." → Yes! (complete)
- "The sleeping cat." → No! (What about the cat?)

### Concept 2: Finding the Subject

**Definition:** The subject tells us who or what the sentence is about.

**Types of Subjects:**

**Simple Subject:** The main noun or pronoun

- "**Dogs** bark loudly." (dogs = simple subject)
- "**She** plays piano." (she = simple subject)

**Complete Subject:** The simple subject plus all its describing words

- "**The three happy dogs**" bark loudly. (complete subject)
- "**My talented younger sister**" plays piano. (complete subject)

**Compound Subject:** Two or more subjects joined by "and" or "or"

- "**Tom and Jerry**" are cartoon characters.
- "**Apples or oranges**" make healthy snacks.

**Finding the Subject - The "Who/What" Question:**

1. Find the verb first
2. Ask "Who or what [does the verb]?"
3. The answer is your subject!

**Example:** "The excited children played in the park."

- Verb: played
- Question: Who or what played?
- Answer: The excited children (complete subject)

**Tricky Subjects:**

- **Commands:** "Clean your room!" (subject = you, understood)
- **Questions:** "Are you coming?" (subject = you)
- **Here/There sentences:** "There are cookies." (subject = cookies, not there)

### Concept 3: Finding the Predicate

**Definition:** The predicate tells us what the subject does or is.

**Types of Predicates:**

**Simple Predicate:** Just the main verb

- "Dogs **bark** loudly." (bark = simple predicate)
- "She **is** my friend." (is = simple predicate)

**Complete Predicate:** The verb plus all words that go with it

- "Dogs **bark loudly at strangers**." (complete predicate)
- "She **is my very best friend**." (complete predicate)

**Compound Predicate:** Two or more predicates for the same subject

- "The dog **barks** and **wags** its tail."
- "Sarah **studied hard** and **passed** the test."

**Finding the Predicate:**

1. Find the subject first
2. Ask "What does the subject do?" or "What is the subject like?"
3. Everything else in the sentence is usually the predicate!

### Concept 4: Sentence Types by Structure

**Simple Sentences:**
One subject + one predicate = one complete thought

- "Birds fly."
- "The small child quickly ate her lunch."
- "Tom and Lisa play together." (compound subject, still simple sentence)

**Compound Sentences:**
Two or more simple sentences joined by conjunctions

- "I like pizza, **and** my brother likes pasta."
- "We can go swimming, **or** we can play games."
- "It was raining, **so** we stayed inside."

**Common Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):**

- **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o

**Compound Sentence Pattern:**
[Simple sentence] + [comma] + [coordinating conjunction] + [simple sentence]

### Concept 5: Fragments vs Complete Sentences

**Sentence Fragments:** Groups of words that don't express a complete thought

**Common Fragment Types:**

**Missing Subject:**

- Fragment: "Ran to the store."
- Complete: "**She** ran to the store."

**Missing Predicate:**

- Fragment: "The big, scary monster."
- Complete: "The big, scary monster **roared loudly**."

**Dependent Clause Fragments:**

- Fragment: "Because I was tired."
- Complete: "**I went to bed early** because I was tired."

**Phrase Fragments:**

- Fragment: "In the morning."
- Complete: "**I exercise** in the morning."

**Fragment Fix Strategies:**

1. Add a subject: Who or what is doing something?
2. Add a predicate: What are they doing or what are they like?
3. Connect to another sentence
4. Remove words that make it dependent (because, when, if)

## Interactive Exercises

### Exercise 1: Subject-Predicate Split (Visual Division)

**Type:** Interactive Sentence Splitter

**Instructions:** "Draw a line between the subject and predicate in each sentence!"

1. **The hungry students | quickly ate their lunch.**

   - Subject: The hungry students
   - Predicate: quickly ate their lunch

2. **My favorite book | sits on the shelf.**
   - Subject: My favorite book
   - Predicate: sits on the shelf

**Visual Feedback:** Sentences split with animated dividing line, with subject highlighted in blue and predicate in red.

### Exercise 2: Fragment Detective (Classification Game)

**Type:** Drag and Drop Sorting

**Instructions:** "Sort these into 'Complete Sentences' or 'Fragments'!"

**Items to Sort:**

- "The dog barks." (Complete)
- "Running in circles." (Fragment - missing subject)
- "She is my friend." (Complete)
- "The tall building downtown." (Fragment - missing predicate)
- "Because it was raining." (Fragment - dependent clause)
- "We went home early." (Complete)

**Progressive Difficulty:** Start with obvious examples, then add trickier fragments with dependent clauses.

### Exercise 3: Sentence Builder Workshop

**Type:** Interactive Construction Tool

**Instructions:** "Build complete sentences using these parts!"

**Word Banks:**

- **Subjects:** The cat, My teacher, Tom and Lisa, The students
- **Predicates:** reads books, played soccer, sleeps peacefully, worked hard

**Advanced Mode:** Add conjunctions to create compound sentences

- "The cat sleeps peacefully, and the dog plays outside."

**Real-time Validation:**

- Green check for complete sentences
- Red X with specific feedback for fragments
- Yellow warning for run-on sentences

### Exercise 4: Compound Sentence Creator

**Type:** Sentence Combining Practice

**Instructions:** "Combine these simple sentences using FANBOYS conjunctions!"

1. **Simple:** "I love reading. My sister prefers movies."
   **Combined:** "I love reading, but my sister prefers movies."

2. **Simple:** "We could go swimming. We could play tennis."
   **Combined:** "We could go swimming, or we could play tennis."

**Smart Feedback:** Suggests appropriate conjunctions based on relationship between ideas.

   - a) The three little kittens
   - b) kittens
   - c) lost their mittens
   - d) three little

2. **Which is a sentence fragment?**

   - b) Compound sentence
   - c) Fragment
   - d) Question

4. **Fix this fragment by adding what's missing:** "The excited children at the playground."

   - Sample answer: "The excited children **played** at the playground." (added predicate)

5. **Circle the subject and underline the predicate:**
   "My grandmother's delicious cookies disappeared quickly."
   - Subject: My grandmother's delicious cookies
   - Predicate: disappeared quickly

**Scoring:**

- 4-5 correct (80-100%): Proceed to next lesson
- 2-3 correct (40-60%): Corrective instruction needed
- 0-1 correct (0-20%): Restart lesson with additional support

## Corrective Instruction (If Mastery Not Achieved)

### For Students Who Struggled with Subject Identification:

**The "Who or What" Detective Method:**
"Every sentence is about someone or something. Find the action first, then ask 'Who or what is doing this action?'"

**Physical Activity:**

- Students act out sentences
- "Sarah jumps." → Point to student being Sarah (subject)
- "The ball rolls." → Point to ball (subject)

**Color-Coding System:**

- Subject = BLUE (like the sky that covers everything)
- Predicate = RED (like action and energy)

### For Students Who Confused Fragments and Sentences:

**The "Complete Thought" Test:**
"If someone said just these words to you, would you understand what happened?"

- "The dog." → "What about the dog?" (incomplete)
- "The dog barks." → "I understand!" (complete)

**Build-a-Sentence Game:**
Start with fragments, add pieces until complete:

1. "Running" (what's missing?)
2. "The boy running" (what's missing?)
3. "The boy is running" (complete!)

### For Students Who Struggled with Compound Sentences:

**Two-Story Building Analogy:**
"A compound sentence is like a building with two floors connected by stairs (the conjunction)."

- First floor: "I like ice cream"
- Stairs (conjunction): "and"
- Second floor: "my sister likes cake"
- Complete building: "I like ice cream, and my sister likes cake."

**FANBOYS Memory Tricks:**

- **F**or = because
- **A**nd = plus/also
- **N**or = and not
- **B**ut = however
- **O**r = choice between
- **Y**et = but/however
- **S**o = therefore

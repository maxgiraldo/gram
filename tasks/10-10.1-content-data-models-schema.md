   - Content branching/forking support
   - Multi-language support with language-specific versions
   - Complete authorship tracking

2. **ContentTag** - Hierarchical tagging system with:
   - Parent/child tag relationships for taxonomy
   - Color coding for UI display
   - Category classification (topic, difficulty, skill, assessment_type)
   - Usage tracking and analytics
   - Relationships to all content types

3. **ContentCategory** - Structured categorization with:
   - Hierarchical category trees
   - Slug-based URLs for SEO
   - Icon support for UI
   - Sort ordering and activation controls

5. **ContentDependency** - Advanced relationship modeling:

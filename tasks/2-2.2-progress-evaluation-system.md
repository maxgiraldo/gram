## Description

Build system to evaluate learner progress against specific learning objectives. This system will map learner performance to competencies and make decisions about learning path progression.

## Deliverables

- [x] `/lib/assessment/progress-evaluator.ts`
- [x] Competency mapping algorithms
- [x] Learning path decision engine
- [x] Objective completion tracking
- [x] Progress visualization data generation

## Implementation Notes

**Progress Evaluation System Completed Successfully!**

### What was built:

- **Core Progress Evaluator**: Complete system for evaluating learner progress against learning objectives
- **Multi-Level Tracking**: Objective → Lesson → Unit progress evaluation with proper aggregation
- **Competency Mapping**: Sophisticated competency level assignment (novice to expert) with confidence scoring
- **Learning Path Decisions**: Smart decision engine for progression, remediation, and enrichment recommendations
- **Progress Visualization**: Comprehensive data generation for dashboards, charts, and analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Advanced metrics calculation including accuracy, efficiency, consistency, improvement trends

### Key Features:

- **Mastery Integration**: Built on top of existing mastery calculator with proper threshold enforcement
- **Prerequisite Management**: Complete prerequisite checking and dependency resolution
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for next steps based on performance patterns
- **Data Visualization**: Rich data structures for progress dashboards, competency radar charts, and trends
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed performance metrics with efficiency and improvement tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of edge cases and missing data

### Advanced Capabilities:

- **Multi-dimensional Progress**: Tracks progress across objectives, lessons, units, and overall curriculum
- **Competency Confidence**: Statistical confidence scoring based on evidence count and performance
- **Smart Remediation**: Identifies specific struggling areas and generates targeted remediation content
- **Enrichment Detection**: Automatically identifies high-performing learners and suggests advanced content
- **Temporal Analysis**: Performance trends and improvement tracking over time
- **Flexible Architecture**: Extensible design for additional metrics and evaluation criteria

### Files Created:

- `/src/lib/assessment/progress-evaluator.ts` - Main implementation (610+ lines)
- `/src/lib/assessment/__tests__/progress-evaluator.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (33 tests)

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Progress evaluation algorithms work correctly
- [x] Competency mapping is accurate

## Description

Environment-based configuration for local vs hosted deployment with environment detection and feature flag system.

## Deliverables

- [x] Environment detection (LOCAL, HOSTED_FREE, HOSTED_PREMIUM)
- [x] Database connection string management
- [x] Feature flag system for premium vs free features
- [x] Configuration validation and error handling
- [x] Environment-specific optimizations

## Implementation Notes

**Environment Configuration System Successfully Implemented!**

### What was built:

**Complete Environment Management:**
1. **Environment Detection** - Automatic detection of LOCAL, HOSTED_FREE, HOSTED_PREMIUM, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, STAGING, PRODUCTION
2. **Deployment Tier System** - LOCAL, FREE, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE tiers with tier-specific configurations
3. **Feature Flag System** - Comprehensive feature flags for core, premium, and enterprise features
4. **Resource Limits** - Tier-based resource management and quota enforcement
5. **Security Configuration** - Progressive security policies from local to enterprise
6. **Optimization Settings** - Environment-specific performance optimizations
7. **Monitoring Configuration** - Tier-appropriate monitoring and logging

**Environment Detection Engine:**
- Detects environment from GRAM_ENVIRONMENT, NODE_ENV variables
- Platform detection (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku) for hosted environments
- Database URL analysis for tier determination
- Fallback to local development for unknown environments

**Feature Flag System:**
- **Core Features**: User registration, guest mode, offline mode
- **Premium Features**: Unlimited lessons, advanced analytics, custom content, data export
- **Enterprise Features**: SSO integration, bulk user management, advanced reporting, API access
- **Experimental Features**: AI tutor, voice recognition, gamification, social learning

**Tier-Based Resource Limits:**
- User limits, lesson quotas, exercise limits per tier
- Storage and upload size restrictions
- Connection pooling and performance limits
- Session timeout and security policies

**Advanced Configuration:**
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with provider abstraction layer
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive configuration validation with detailed error messages
- **Caching Strategy**: Configuration caching with refresh capabilities
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for feature checks and limit retrieval

### Files Created:

1. **`/src/lib/config/environment.ts`** - Core environment detection and configuration (850+ lines)
2. **`/src/lib/config/index.ts`** - Main configuration factory and utilities (400+ lines)
3. **`/src/lib/config/__tests__/environment.test.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite (300+ lines, 34 tests)

### Performance & Reliability:

- ✅ **34 comprehensive tests** all passing
- ✅ **Type-safe** implementation with full TypeScript support
- ✅ **Production-ready** with validation and error handling
- ✅ **Tier-aware** configuration for all deployment scenarios
- ✅ **1,550+ lines of code** implementing complete environment management
- ✅ **Zero compilation errors** in configuration system

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Environment detection is accurate
- [x] Connection management is reliable
- [x] Feature flags work correctly
- [x] Validation catches configuration errors
- [x] Optimizations are environment-appropriate

## Assignment

- **Agent**: Claude
- **Estimated Time**: 3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Started**: 2025-08-12
- **Completed**: 2025-08-12

## Description

Implement core mastery learning algorithms including 80/90% thresholds, scoring calculations, and mastery determination logic for different exercise types.

## Deliverables

- [x] `/lib/assessment/mastery-calculator.ts`
- [x] Scoring algorithms for different exercise types
- [x] Mastery threshold validation logic
- [x] Performance tracking utilities
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests

## Algorithm Requirements

- **Mastery Thresholds**: 80% for initial mastery, 90% for retention
- **Score Calculation**: Support for partial credit, weighted questions
- **Exercise Types**: Multiple choice, fill-in-blank, drag-and-drop, sentence building
- **Progress Tracking**: Track attempts, time spent, improvement over time

## Implementation Notes

**Mastery Calculator Logic Completed Successfully!**

### What was built:

- **Core Mastery Algorithms**: Complete implementation with 80% lesson progression and 90% unit completion thresholds
- **Multi-Exercise Type Scoring**: Support for multiple choice, fill-in-blank, drag-and-drop, and sentence building exercises
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including accuracy, efficiency, consistency, improvement trends, and retention rates
- **Adaptive Penalties**: Smart penalty system for hints used and time overruns
- **Progress Evaluation**: Logic to determine progression eligibility and remediation needs

### Key Features:

- **Mastery Learning Compliant**: Proper 80/90% thresholds with configurable parameters
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Intelligent string similarity for fill-in-blank questions with partial credit
- **Performance Analytics**: Advanced metrics calculation with trend analysis
- **Recommendation Engine**: Context-aware recommendations for remediation and enrichment
- **Edge Case Handling**: Robust error handling for edge cases and invalid inputs

### Testing:

- **50 Comprehensive Tests**: Complete test coverage using Vitest
- **All Test Cases Pass**: Edge cases, performance scenarios, and algorithm validation
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Zero TypeScript errors with proper type safety

### Files Created:

- `/src/lib/assessment/mastery-calculator.ts` - Main implementation (502 lines)
- `/__tests__/lib/assessment/mastery-calculator.test.ts` - Test suite (50 tests)
- `/vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- Updated `package.json` with test scripts

## Testing Requirements

- [x] All scoring algorithms tested with edge cases
- [x] Mastery threshold logic validates correctly
- [x] Performance calculations are accurate
- [x] Handle invalid input gracefully
- [x] Test with various exercise type combinations

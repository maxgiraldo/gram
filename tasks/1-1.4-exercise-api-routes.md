## Assignment

- **Agent**: Claude
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.2
- **Started**: 2025-08-12
- **Completed**: 2025-08-12

## Description

Create API endpoints for exercise management including submission, validation, and feedback. These endpoints will handle different exercise types and provide real-time scoring and feedback.

## Deliverables

- [x] `/app/api/exercises/` route handlers
- [x] Exercise submission and validation endpoints
- [x] Feedback and scoring API routes
- [x] Exercise type-specific handling
- [x] Performance tracking endpoints

## Implementation Notes

**Exercise API Routes Successfully Implemented!**

### What was built:

**Complete Exercise Management API:**

1. **Exercise CRUD Operations** (`/app/api/exercises/`):
   - GET: List exercises with filtering by lesson
   - POST: Create new exercises with validation
   - PUT: Update exercise properties
   - DELETE: Remove exercises safely

2. **Exercise Question Management** (`/app/api/exercises/[id]/questions/`):
   - GET: Retrieve all questions for an exercise
   - POST: Create new questions with type-specific validation
   - Supports multiple choice, fill-in-blank, drag-and-drop, sentence builder

3. **Exercise Attempt System** (`/app/api/exercises/[id]/attempts/`):
   - GET: User's attempt history
   - POST: Start new exercise attempts
   - PUT: Update and complete attempts with scoring

4. **Response Submission & Validation** (`/app/api/exercises/attempts/[attemptId]/responses/`):
   - POST: Submit responses with real-time validation
   - GET: Retrieve all responses for an attempt
   - Advanced validation logic for all question types

5. **Performance Analytics** (`/app/api/exercises/analytics/`):
   - GET: Comprehensive analytics and statistics
   - POST: Record analytics events
   - User progress tracking and system-wide metrics

**Advanced Validation System:**

6. **Exercise Validation Logic** (`/lib/exercises/validation.ts`):
   - Type-specific validation for all question types
   - Partial credit calculation
   - Smart feedback generation
   - Hint system with progressive difficulty
   - Performance analysis for remediation/enrichment

**Database Layer:**

7. **Exercise Database Queries** (`/lib/db/queries/exercises.ts`):
   - Complete CRUD operations for exercises, questions, attempts, responses
   - Score calculation and completion tracking
   - Statistics and analytics queries
   - Foreign key validation and constraint management

### Key Features Implemented:

**✅ Exercise Management:**
- Full exercise lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
- Order management within lessons
- Type-specific configuration (practice, reinforcement, challenge, enrichment)
- Time limits and attempt restrictions

**✅ Question System:**
- Multiple choice with shuffling options
- Fill-in-blank with multiple acceptable answers
- Drag-and-drop with category validation
- Sentence builder with flexible/strict matching
- Comprehensive question data validation

**✅ Submission & Validation:**
- Real-time response validation
- Intelligent scoring with partial credit
- Type-specific feedback generation
- Progressive hint system
- Performance tracking per question

**✅ Analytics & Tracking:**
- Exercise completion statistics
- Score distribution analysis
- Common error identification
- Time analytics and performance metrics
- User progress evaluation

**✅ Advanced Features:**
- Attempt limit enforcement
- Automatic score calculation
- Remediation need detection
- Enrichment eligibility assessment
- Comprehensive error handling

### Database Integration:
- **Full Prisma integration** with optimized queries
- **Transaction support** for data consistency
- **Foreign key validation** and relationship management
- **Provider abstraction** compatibility (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Comprehensive error handling** with custom error types

### API Design:
- **RESTful endpoints** following Next.js App Router conventions
- **Type-safe request/response** handling
- **Comprehensive validation** with detailed error messages
- **Consistent response format** across all endpoints
- **Performance optimizations** with query caching

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Exercise submission works for all types
- [x] Validation logic is accurate
- [x] Scoring calculations are correct
- [x] Feedback generation works properly
- [x] Performance data is tracked accurately

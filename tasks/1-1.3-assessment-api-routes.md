- **Started**: 2025-08-12
- **Completed**: 2025-08-13

## Description

Build REST API endpoints for assessments and progress tracking. This includes creating, reading, updating assessment data and tracking learner progress through the mastery learning system.

## Deliverables

- [x] `/app/api/assessments/` route handlers
- [x] `/app/api/progress/` route handlers
- [x] API documentation and TypeScript contracts
- [x] Request/response validation
- [x] Authentication middleware

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive REST API infrastructure with 3,400+ lines of code:

### Core Features
- Complete assessment CRUD operations with mastery learning support
- Progress tracking for lessons and learning objectives
- Comprehensive request/response validation with detailed error messages
- Flexible authentication supporting JWT tokens and API keys
- Type-safe API contracts with TypeScript interfaces

### Key Technical Decisions
- Used Next.js App Router for modern API architecture
- Implemented mastery thresholds (80% lesson progression, 90% unit completion)
- Created comprehensive error handling with structured validation errors
- Built flexible authentication middleware with development mode support
- Added extensive test coverage for all validation and authentication logic

### API Endpoints Created
- `/api/assessments` - Assessment CRUD operations
- `/api/assessments/[id]` - Individual assessment management
- `/api/assessments/[id]/attempts` - Assessment attempt tracking
- `/api/progress` - Lesson progress tracking
- `/api/progress/objectives` - Learning objective progress

## Testing Requirements

- [x] All API endpoints return correct data
- [x] Request validation works properly
- [x] Error responses are properly formatted
- [x] Authentication is properly enforced
- [x] API documentation is complete and accurate

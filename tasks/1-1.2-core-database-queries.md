## Assignment

- **Agent**: Claude-Amp
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1
- **Started**: 2025-01-08
- **Completed**: 2025-01-08

## Description

Implement data access layer with typed queries for all database operations. This layer will provide a consistent interface for database operations and include proper TypeScript typing for all data models.

## Deliverables

- [x] `/lib/db/queries/` folder with CRUD operations
- [x] TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- [x] Query optimization and indexing
- [x] Database connection management
- [x] Error handling and validation

## Implementation Notes

**Comprehensive Database Access Layer Completed:**

**Core Architecture:**
- Centralized Prisma client with connection pooling and lifecycle management
- Robust error handling with custom error types (DatabaseError, ValidationError, NotFoundError)
- Transaction support with retry logic for resilience
- Pagination utilities for efficient data loading
- Query performance monitoring and logging

**Key Components Built:**

1. **Database Client (`client.ts`)** - 322 lines
   - Connection management with health checks
   - Transaction utilities with retry logic
   - Pagination helpers with consistent interface
   - Error handling with classification system
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup

2. **Unit Queries (`units.ts`)** - 750+ lines
   - Full CRUD operations with validation
   - Prerequisite validation and dependency management
   - Publishing/unpublishing workflow
   - Advanced filtering and search
   - Reordering capabilities
   - Statistics and analytics

3. **Lesson Queries (`lessons.ts`)** - 850+ lines
   - Complete lesson lifecycle management
   - Content versioning and tagging support
   - Progress tracking integration
   - Multi-level filtering (unit, difficulty, tags)
   - Next lesson recommendation logic
   - Content search capabilities

4. **Query Index (`index.ts`)** - 140 lines
   - Centralized exports for all query modules
   - Batch operation utilities
   - Common query patterns
   - Database maintenance utilities

**Advanced Features:**
- **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive input validation with descriptive errors
- **Relationship Management**: Complex joins with optimized includes
- **Soft Deletes**: Unpublishing before hard deletion for safety
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps on all operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic use of includes and selects
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with Prisma types

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Comprehensive test suites for Units and Lessons
- Edge case coverage and error handling validation
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Database cleanup and isolation between tests

## Testing Requirements

- [x] All CRUD operations tested
- [x] TypeScript interfaces validate correctly
- [x] Query performance is optimized
- [x] Error handling works properly
- [x] Database indexes improve query performance

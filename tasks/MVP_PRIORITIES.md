# MVP Task Prioritization

## 🎯 MVP Goal

Create a minimal working grammar learning app where users can:

1. View a lesson
2. Complete exercises
3. Take an assessment
4. See their progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Core MVP (Week 1)

**Goal: Basic working app with one complete learning flow**

### HIGH PRIORITY - Assign Immediately:

1. **Task 1.4: Exercise API Routes** - Backend for exercises (COMPLETED)
2. **Task 2.3: Assessment Interface Components** - UI for taking assessments (IN PROGRESS)
3. **Task 3.4: Content Navigation System** - Navigate between lessons
4. **Task 4.3: Real-time Feedback System** - Show if answers are correct
5. **Task 4.4: Exercise Validation Logic** - Check exercise answers

### Create Sample Content:

- **NEW TASK**: Create 1-2 sample lessons with exercises

**Only after MVP is working**

- Task 7.2: Learning Analytics Engine
- Task 8.4: Theme and Styling System

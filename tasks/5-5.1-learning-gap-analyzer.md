## Implementation Notes

**Learning Gap Analyzer Successfully Implemented!**

### What was built:

**Comprehensive AI-Driven Gap Analysis System:**

1. **Learning Gap Analyzer Core** (`src/lib/corrective/gap-analyzer.ts`):

   - LearningGapAnalyzer class with intelligent gap detection
   - 8 different gap types: conceptual understanding, procedural knowledge, factual recall, application skills, pattern recognition, metacognitive awareness, prerequisite knowledge, transfer skills
   - 4 severity levels: critical, major, moderate, minor
   - Evidence-based gap identification with confidence scoring
   - Relationship analysis between interconnected gaps
   - 970+ lines of production code

2. **Error Pattern Recognition**:

   - 8 error pattern types: consistent misconception, incomplete understanding, procedural error, computational mistake, reading comprehension, attention to detail, problem interpretation, strategy selection
   - Frequency and consistency analysis
   - Pattern-to-gap-type mapping
   - Suggested cause inference
   - Evidence collection and examples

3. **Gap Detection Algorithms**:

   - **Conceptual Understanding Gaps**: Detects poor conceptual grasp through accuracy and consistency metrics
   - **Procedural Knowledge Gaps**: Identifies procedural skill deficits through efficiency analysis
   - **Prerequisite Knowledge Gaps**: Maps missing foundational knowledge through dependency analysis
   - **Application Skill Gaps**: Detects inability to apply knowledge through cognitive level performance
   - **Pattern-Based Gaps**: Uses error patterns to identify systematic issues
   - **Metacognitive Gaps**: Analyzes self-monitoring through hint usage patterns

4. **Diagnostic Recommendation Engine**:
   - Priority-based recommendation system (immediate, high, medium, low)
   - 4 recommendation types: remediation, review, practice, instruction
   - 5 intervention types: content review, guided practice, peer collaboration, adaptive exercises, conceptual instruction
   - Adaptive intervention rules based on performance conditions
   - Estimated effort calculation and success criteria definition

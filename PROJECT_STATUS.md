- **3.1**: Lesson Content Models (3 hours)
- **4.1**: Exercise Type Components (8 hours) 
- **6.1**: Challenge Generator (5 hours)
- **12.1**: Testing Infrastructure Setup (4 hours)

**Newly Unlocked Dependencies:**
- **8.2**: Layout and Navigation (5 hours) - *Depends on 8.1 ✅*

- **2.2**: Progress Evaluation System (4 hours) - *Depends on 2.1 ✅*
- **2.3**: Assessment Interface Components (5 hours) - *Depends on 2.1 ✅ + 8.1 ✅*

### 🔵 **Active Agents**

| Agent | Status | Current Task | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| **ZenCoder** | 🟢 Available | None | Completed 1.1, ready for next assignment |
| **Claude** | 🟢 Available | None | Completed 2.1 & 8.1, high productivity |

### ⏸️ **Blocked Tasks**

**Major Dependencies Still Needed:**
- **1.2**: Core Database Queries - *Depends on 1.1 ✅* → **Should be Available**
- **1.3**: Assessment API Routes - *Depends on 1.2*
- **1.4**: Exercise API Routes - *Depends on 1.2*

## 📊 **Progress Metrics**

### **Foundation Phase Progress (30%)**
```
████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 30%

Completed: 3/10 priority tasks
Available: 8 tasks ready for work
Blocked: ~40 tasks awaiting dependencies
```

### **Track-by-Track Status**

| Track | Progress | Key Status |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **🏗️ Database & API** | 33% (1/3) | Schema ✅, Queries Available, APIs Blocked |
| **🧠 Assessment Engine** | 50% (2/4) | Calculator ✅, Interface Ready, Evaluation Ready |
| **📚 Content Management** | 0% (0/4) | All Available for Assignment |
| **🎯 Exercise System** | 0% (0/4) | Components Available, Rest Blocked |
| **🎨 UI/UX Components** | 25% (1/4) | Core UI ✅, Layout+Nav+Theme Available |
| **🧪 Testing** | 0% (0/4) | Infrastructure Setup Available |

### **Team Performance**

**Completed Work Quality:**
- ✅ All tasks passing QA tests
- ✅ TypeScript compliance maintained
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (50+ unit tests)
- ✅ Documentation standards met

**Productivity:**
- **ZenCoder**: 1 task completed (Database Schema - complex)
- **Claude**: 2 tasks completed (Calculator + UI Components)
- **Average Time**: Tasks completed within estimates

## 🚨 **Critical Items & Bottlenecks**

### **Immediate Actions Needed:**

1. **Task 1.2 Should be Available** - Core Database Queries depends on completed Task 1.1
2. **Agent Task Assignment** - 8 tasks ready but no active assignments
3. **ZenCoder Log Update** - Log file shows Available but should show recent completion

### **High-Priority Next Steps:**

**For ZenCoder:**
- Update personal log with Task 1.1 completion
- Select next task from available pool
- Recommended: Task 1.2 (Core Database Queries) to continue database track

**For New Agents:**
- Task 3.1: Lesson Content Models (independent, 3 hours)
- Task 4.1: Exercise Type Components (independent, 8 hours)
- Task 12.1: Testing Infrastructure Setup (independent, 4 hours)

## 🎯 **Week 1-2 Goals Status**

**Original Foundation Goals:**
- ✅ Database schema and Prisma setup
- ✅ Core UI component library (Tailwind)
- ✅ Mastery learning assessment logic
- 🟡 Exercise type components (Available)
- 🟡 Testing infrastructure (Available)

**On Track**: 3/5 goals complete, 2 ready for immediate work

## 📈 **Project Health: GOOD**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Strong foundation completed (Database + Assessment + UI)
- ✅ High code quality with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Clear task management system preventing conflicts
- ✅ Multiple tasks ready for parallel development

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ Need more active agents to maintain velocity
- ⚠️ Some dependency chains may create bottlenecks later
- ⚠️ Task assignment coordination needs improvement

## 🔮 **Next Phase Readiness**

**To Enter Phase 2 (Core Systems) - Need:**
- Task 1.2: Core Database Queries → Unlocks API development
- Task 3.1: Lesson Content Models → Unlocks content management
- Task 4.1: Exercise Type Components → Unlocks exercise system

**Estimated Time to Phase 2**: 2-3 days with 2-3 active agents

---

**Status Summary**: Foundation phase progressing well. Core infrastructure complete, ready for parallel development across multiple tracks. Need agent task assignments to maintain momentum.
